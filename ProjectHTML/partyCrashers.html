        <h1>Party Crashers</h1>
        
        <p>Party Crashers is an asymmetric VR party game in which one player dons a headset to host a virtual bash with friends joining from any web connected device!</p>
        
        <p>Party Crashers aims to solve a prevalent problem: VR is fun, but only for the person in the headset. The goal is to create a game that involves everyone in the room. I want to allow users to share the fun of VR with friends locally and ones miles away. Like many VR owners, I want to show friends the allure of the platform. But when I looked for multi-platform games I came up short. There was no easy to set-up games, so I made my own.</p>

        <p>One of the most important aspects of the game is accessibility. I wanted to create a game that required zero hassle to set up and play. I had played other asynchronous VR titles, but they required to set up the headset to a PC, connect that PC to a TV, or required users to download a mobile app. With Party Crashers you can just go to the website, type in the code and start playing</p>

        <p>The project utilizes Unity and C# and runs on Android for VR headsets, as well as in WebGL to run on mobile browsers. <a href="https://normcore.io/" target="_blank">Normcore</a> is used to network between devices</p>

        <p>I've also done some mixed reality prototyping as it could provide a unique way to experience the game:</p>
