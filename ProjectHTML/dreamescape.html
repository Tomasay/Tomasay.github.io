        <h1>DreamEscape</h1>
        
        <p>During the 2018-2019 school year, I worked as a 3D asset producer for an academic project called DreamEscape. The project was for a class called Capstone Design, which is a year-long course for students in the Game Design & Development Masters Program. Although I was not enrolled in the course, I worked as a part of the team to help create assets and collaborate to create the game's visual style</p>
        
        <p>The main model for the first level is a pirate ship. We decided on a simplistic/cartoonish style for the game, so I created the model in Blender and textured it in Substance Painter to fit the theme. After importing the model into Unity, I added a toon shader along with some low poly assets from Unity's asset store to really bring the scene together</p>

        <p>One of the assets I created is a cannon, which is animated using shape keys in Blender. I also created a particle effect system to go along with it in Unity</p>
